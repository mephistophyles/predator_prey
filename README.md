# predator_prey
A simple predator prey simulation

The single_pred_prey# files show a progression of (slightly contrived) iterative development. 

The pred_prey_sim file shows the same but updated through the github repository commits. It also shows that sometimes it is better to take a step back, review and plan what you want it to do and then build vs building a quick prototype and then updating it incrementally, which often cages you to the original approach.
